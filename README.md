# Placement Season Leetcode

Just pushing my LeetCode solutions here as I go through placement prep. These contain my thought process and takeaways for each problem. 

I'm following the Neetcode 150 roadmap - credit to them for the curated problem list. Not trying to reinvent the wheel, just documenting my learning journey.

## What's Here
- Python solutions to coding problems
- Brief explanations of approaches
- Things I learned from each problem
- Common patterns I noticed

## How I'm Using This
1. Pick a problem from Neetcode's list
2. Solve it myself first
3. Compare with optimal solutions
4. Document my understanding

All solutions are my own work, though obviously inspired by Neetcode's explanations and other standard resources.

Good luck with your own prep!
